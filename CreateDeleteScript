-- What if you want to create a stored script from a script file in the file system? You can import the file into the catalog. 
-- Here is an example:

RMAN> create script backup_ts_users from file 'backup_ts_users.rman';
-- Conversely, you can create a file from a stored script (or export a stored script to a file). Here is an example:

RMAN> print script backup_ts_users to file 'backup_ts_users.rman';
